# 🔌 Arduino LED Control with 3 Buttons

This project is a simple **Arduino-based LED control system** using **3 push buttons** and **6 LEDs** connected through a breadboard.

Each button controls **2 LEDs**, and when a button is pressed:
- First press 👉 turns the LEDs **OFF**.
- Second press 👉 turns the same LEDs **ON**.
This toggle behavior provides a clean interaction using limited hardware!

## 🧰 Components Used

- Arduino UNO
- Breadboard
- 6 LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red, etc.)
- 3 Push Buttons
- Resistors
- Jumper wires

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Button 1:** Toggles LED 1 and LED 2  
- **Button 2:** Toggles LED 3 and LED 4  
- **Button 3:** Toggles LED 5 and LED 6

The circuit uses digital input from the buttons and toggles output to the LEDs based on a simple state management logic.
